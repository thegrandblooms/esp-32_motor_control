# esp-32_motor_control
Control stepper motors using an ESP32-C6

This also takes in input from an EC11 Rotary Encoder and has a UI display built in LVGL for this ESP32 package from waveshare: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47

This code is modular and can interface with DRV8825 and LN298N motor controllers
